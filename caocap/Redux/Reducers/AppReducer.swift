 Reducers: Directly change the application state, which is stored in the Store.
 
 - Reducers are the only blocks that can directly change the current value of the AppState held by the Store,
 - The Reducer changes the current value of AppState depending on the type of Action it receives.
 
 appReducer is a function that takes an Action and returns the changed AppState.
 state is the current state of the app
