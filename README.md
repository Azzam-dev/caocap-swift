# caocap swift

old code for the caocap iOS app

Thanks to the great team who walked with me on the journey of developing caocap,
our journey is not over but has just begun

Remember not to include failure in your vocabulary, but it is always one of two things,
either you succeed or you learn and try again

You just have to stand up and face the challenges when everyone else quits
Tell me, where is the pleasure of living without challenges, and what is the value of victory if it is easy?
